For the hardware Pulse width modulation the objective is still the same, and that is to change the brightness of the LED. With this though the idea is that we have to change the LED using the output of the timer modules instead of doing it manually through software. Two timers are used in this method one for debouncing and another for controlling the outputs. The same method is still used to cycle through the pulse width modulation. The initial 50% duty cycle is set outside the code incremented inside the code then set to the CCR1 register to be outputted directly to the LED. In this code OUTMOD is used to send the output of the timer directly to the LED. With the F55 I had to set the output of the timer to a different pin then run a jumper to the LED to get the LED to run. The LEDs on the F55 did not have the proper registers to run the code the same way as used on the G2.
