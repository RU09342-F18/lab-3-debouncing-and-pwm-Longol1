Software pulse width modulation is used in this case to have two timers running at once which will help set the brightness of an LED to different brightnesses. For the softare you use one timer to set to CCR0 which will be the full cycle of the clock. To change the brightness you need to change the duty cycle. When coming up with a way to do this I looked at a bunch of different example code to figure out different ways I could implement this. I ended up deciding it was very useful to declare the duty cycle originally outside of main as 50% and increment it inside the code. I was having trouble with figuring out how to make it go from state to state, until I found a few examples use the method of an state variable that is created outside the main code. Then on the inside of the code the variable is changed to move the timer and button to different states and it is recognized and executed using a switch statement. This is the method that after doing some digging I found to be most useful for the way I wanted my code to work.
